# NukedSCPlayer
NukedSCPlayer is an interface for [Nukeykt's](https://github.com/nukeykt) [Nuked-SC55](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-SC55) MIDI emulator that allows users to play midi files through the commandline.

## Requirements
NukedSCPlayer uses multiple python packages to work:

```
pip install mido
pip install pynput
```
or you can install the packages system wide on linux:
```
sudo apt install python3-mido
sudo apt install python3-pynput
```

## Known Bugs
- Stopping playback doesn't end
- more to add...

## Future Plans
- Make a GUI (GUI is already made, I just need to add the functions to it.)
